            <p>
                Seshat, was the ancient Egyptian goddess of wisdom, knowledge, and writing. She was seen as a scribe and
                record keeper, and her name means she who scrivens (i.e. she who is the scribe), and is credited with
                inventing writing. She also became identified as the goddess of accounting, architecture,
                astronomy, astrology, building, mathematics, and surveying.
                In art, she was depicted as a woman with a seven-pointed emblem above her head. It is unclear what this
                emblem represents. This emblem is the origin of an alternate name for Seshat, Sefkhet-Abwy,
                which means “seven-horned”.
                Mistress of the House of Books is another title for Seshat, being the deity whose priests oversaw the
                library in which scrolls of the most important knowledge were assembled and spells were preserved. One
                prince of the Fourth Dynasty, Wep-em-nefret, is noted as the Overseer of the Royal Scribes, Priest of
                Seshat on a slab stela. Heliopolis was the location of her principal sanctuary. She also was responsible
                for recording the speeches the pharaoh made during the crowning ceremony and approving the inventory of
                foreign captives and goods gained in military campaigns. During the New Kingdom, she was involved in the
                Sed festival held by the pharaohs who could celebrate thirty years of
                reign."</p>
